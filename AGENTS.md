# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What is Ralph?

Ralph is an autonomous AI coding agent loop runner. It runs iterative plan/build cycles using a configurable backend (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, or pi) in headless mode, with shared artifacts (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` plus the per-task files under `plan/` it indexes, and `PROGRESS.md`) as handoffs between iterations. All execution happens inside isolated devcontainers.

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
bats test/

# Run a single test file
bats test/sandbox.bats

# Run a specific test by name
bats test/sandbox.bats -f "sandbox fails when config is missing"

# Lint
shellcheck ralph install.sh
```

CI runs both ShellCheck and BATS on every push/PR to main.

## Architecture

Ralph is a single Bash script (`ralph`) with these commands:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `plan` | Run planning loop (max 6 iterations, exits on convergence) — reads specs/source, produces `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and the `plan/NNN-slug.md` task files it links to |
| `build` | Run build loop (default: 50 iterations) — picks next task, implements, tests, commits, pushes |
| `sandbox` | Enter/manage devcontainer (`sandbox`, `sandbox clean`, `sandbox --rebuild`) |
| `init` | Initialize workspace artifacts and directories |
| `archive` | Move artifacts to `.ralph/<timestamp>/` |
| `clean` | Delete artifacts |

### Core loop flow (`cmd_loop`)

1. Validate CLI dependencies (selected backend's CLI binary, git)
2. Resolve backend via `-b` flag (default: `claude`), which loads the backend's command builder, default model, and jq filter
3. Resolve prompt template: project-local `PROMPT_<mode>.md` → installed default (`~/.config/ralph/prompts/`)
4. Substitute `{{GOAL}}` into prompt via bash parameter expansion
5. Pipe prompt to the backend command in a loop (e.g., `claude -p` or `codex exec`)
6. Parse JSON output with jq using backend-specific flags and filters, push changes after each iteration
7. Detect an early exit, per mode. Build mode watches `HEAD` and stops after 2 consecutive noops, unless `-n` was passed. Plan mode never commits, so it fingerprints `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `plan/` and `specs/` via `plan_state_hash` and stops on the first pass that changes none of them; `-n` caps a plan run but never disables the check, and a converging pass against an empty plan is a failure rather than convergence. Review mode has no early exit: it is read-only, so every iteration is a noop by `HEAD` and any HEAD-based check would cut a multi-pass review short. Each branch names its mode explicitly — none is the default

### The implementation plan contract

`specs/` states *what* to build; the plan states *how*. The plan is two artifacts: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is an index of one-line entries, each linking to a task file at `plan/NNN-slug.md` that holds the detail. Both prompts enforce a closed field schema on the task file (title, `**Status:**`, `Spec`, `Scope`, `Files`, `Steps`, `Done when`, `Completion notes`), a cap of 150 words / 8 steps per task file, and Simplified Technical English. `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` holds exactly three headings; neither artifact carries outcomes or evidence — those belong in `PROGRESS.md`.

Items are mutable during the plan phase and immutable during the build phase, where the only legal edits are ticking a checkbox, marking an entry `- [~]`, appending a new item (index entry plus task file), and filling in the finished item's completion notes. Markers are `- [ ]`, `- [x]`, and `- [~]` (superseded or blocked), each matching the `**Status:**` in its task file. `calculate_build_iterations` counts only `^- \[ \]` below `## Items`, so `[~]` items and the template's example entry neither size the build loop nor count as shipped work. `plan_state_hash` fingerprints the index, `plan/` and `specs/` together, so a pass that only rewrites a task file is not mistaken for convergence. Convergence also requires the plan to hold at least one entry: a pass that changes nothing against an empty plan is a planning failure — the backend answered without doing the work — and exits non-zero rather than reporting success. When changing these rules, keep `prompts/plan.md`, `prompts/build.md` and `templates/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` in agreement — the prompts win on any disagreement.

In `build` mode, each iteration re-reads `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to resolve the
next entry's tier marker — `(light)`/`(heavy)`, written just after the checkbox —
through the backend's `BACKEND_TIER_MODELS` map, and rebuilds `BACKEND_CMD` for
that model, so cheap items run on cheap models. The marker lives on the index
line rather than in the task file so the loop picks the model without opening
`plan/NNN-*.md`. Resolution order is `-m` flag → entry tier →
`BACKEND_DEFAULT_MODEL`; tiering switches off entirely when `-m` is passed, the
mode isn't `build`, or no entry carries a marker. Unknown tiers warn and fall
back rather than aborting a long run.

### Sandbox

Uses the `devcontainer` CLI to manage container lifecycle. Key details:
- Base image: Node.js 20 with Claude Code, gh, git, zsh, jq, ripgrep, SDKMAN
- Mounts: workspace, `~/.claude`, `~/.gitconfig`, `~/.ssh`, Docker socket, SSH agent, ralph binary
- Shell history persists via Docker volumes keyed by a hash of the workspace path
- Runs as `node` user with passwordless sudo

### Installation layout

`install.sh` places files at:
- `~/.local/bin/ralph` — CLI binary
- `~/.config/ralph/prompts/` — default plan/build prompt templates
- `~/.config/ralph/templates/` — artifact templates (PROGRESS.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
- `~/.config/ralph/container/` — devcontainer config + Dockerfile
- `~/.config/ralph/skills/` — bundled Claude Code skills (e.g. `commit`) scaffolded into `<workspace>/.claude/skills/` by `ralph init`

Override with `RALPH_BIN_DIR` and `RALPH_CONFIG_DIR`.

## Testing conventions

- Tests use **BATS** v1.5.0+ (Bash Automated Testing System)
- Each test gets a fresh temp directory with `git init` and a mock `RALPH_CONFIG_DIR` (see `test/test_helper.bash`)
- Use `skip` with a message when a test can't run on the current platform (e.g., missing `devcontainer` CLI, NixOS PATH isolation issues)
- The `path_without` helper in `sandbox.bats` builds a PATH excluding a specific command — but beware that on NixOS/Ubuntu, coreutils share a directory, so stripping one command may break others

## Workflow conventions

- Use the `/commit` skill to commit changes. The skill is bundled with ralph and scaffolded into `<workspace>/.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md` by `ralph init`, so it is available to the agent inside the sandbox.
- The skill produces fine-grained atomic commits with short imperative subjects and an optional 3-bullet body. When the working tree contains separable concerns, the skill splits them into multiple commits in a single invocation.
- If the skill is unavailable, follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

## Shell scripting conventions

- All code lives in the single `ralph` script — no external shell libraries
- Functions are named `cmd_<command>` for top-level commands
- Backend definitions use `backend_<name>` functions that set well-known variables (`BACKEND_CLI`, `BACKEND_DEFAULT_MODEL`, `BACKEND_TIER_MODELS`, `BACKEND_STREAMS_EVENTS`, etc.) and define a `build_backend_cmd` inner function — adding a new backend only requires a new function and a `SUPPORTED_BACKENDS` entry. `BACKEND_TIER_MODELS` must cover every `SUPPORTED_TIERS` key; `BACKEND_STREAMS_EVENTS` declares whether the backend emits per-event JSON, which is what `--stream`'s live log renders
- Use `command -v` to check for CLI dependencies
- Validate early, fail with clear error messages to stderr
- Cross-platform: support both Linux (`md5sum`) and macOS (`md5`) where needed
