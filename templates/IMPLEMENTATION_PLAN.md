# Implementation Plan

**Prioritised index of work items. Order is priority — the build agent picks the top incomplete item.**

This file is an **index only** — one line per item, no detail. The detail for each
item lives in its own task file under `plan/`. That way every iteration can read
the whole queue cheaply and then read only the single task file it is about to
implement.

## Entry Format

This file holds three sections: this title, `## Entry Format`, and `## Items`. Never add another heading.

One bullet per item, on a single line, under `## Items` below:

```markdown
  - [ ] (heavy) **Short imperative title** — one-line description of the outcome. → [NNN-short-slug.md](plan/NNN-short-slug.md)
```

(The example is indented so it isn't mistaken for a real entry — actual entries
start at column 0.)

`NNN` is a zero-padded sequence number, allocated in order and never reused. The
link target must be the item's task file.

### Index rules

- Order is priority. The build agent picks the top incomplete item.
- Write at most 10 words per title. Write one line per entry.
- The index carries the tier, the title, the outcome and the link. Nothing else.
- Record no rationale, no evidence, no history, and no status. The task file and `PROGRESS.md` hold those.

Markers, matching the `**Status:**` in the task file:

- `- [ ]` open
- `- [x]` shipped
- `- [~]` superseded or blocked; never delete it — add a replacement item instead

Anchor every marker at column zero. Never nest one item under another.

### Tiers

`(light)` / `(heavy)` sits immediately after the checkbox and states how much
reasoning the item needs. The build loop picks that iteration's model from it,
so cheap work runs on a cheap model. It lives on the index line rather than in
the task file because the loop chooses the model before it opens the task file.

Tiers are abstract, never model names — the same plan is run by different
backends, each mapping the tier into its own catalogue.

- **light** — follows an established pattern already in the codebase, specs are
  clear and complete, changes are localised to one or two modules.
- **heavy** — cross-cutting refactors, reconciling inconsistent specs,
  debugging failures of unknown cause, or introducing a pattern the codebase
  does not yet have.

Default to **heavy** when genuinely unsure: a wrong `light` costs a failed or
half-finished iteration, which is far more expensive than the tokens it saved.
An entry with no tier falls back to the run's default model.

### Task files

Each `plan/NNN-short-slug.md` holds the detail for exactly one item, in these
fields, in this order, and no others:

````markdown
# NNN. Short imperative title

**Status:** Not started

## Spec

`specs/file.md` item N

## Scope

What is included. What is excluded.

## Files

`path/to/file`, `path/to/other`

## Steps

1. Imperative technical instruction.
2. Imperative technical instruction.

## Done when

Criterion the agent can check without a human.

## Completion notes

_Filled in when the item ships: what shipped, test counts, and any deviation
with its tracking reference. Keep it to a few lines — the narrative belongs in
`PROGRESS.md`._
````

Task file rules:

- The spec states what to build. The task file states how to build it.
- Cite a spec file plus an item number or a section name in `Spec`.
- Write at most 150 words per task file, excluding the completion notes.
- Write at most 2 sentences for `Scope`. Write at most 2 sentences for `Done when`.
- Write at most 8 steps. Write one action per step. Write at most 20 words per step.
- Split any item that needs a ninth step. That item is too large for one iteration.
- Name symbols, option paths, literal values, and files to copy an idiom from.
- Never cite line numbers. Never paste code. Every named token must be greppable.
- List paths only in `Files`.
- Write every field in Simplified Technical English. Use active voice and present tense.

When the item ships, the build agent flips `**Status:**` to `Done`, writes the
completion notes here, and flips the index entry to `- [x]`. The notes stay in
the task file rather than the index, so the queue every iteration re-reads keeps
to one line per item.
