# ralph

Autonomous AI coding agent loop runner. Runs plan and build phases in a loop, feeding structured prompts to an AI coding agent in headless mode. Supports multiple backends — currently [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/index/codex/), [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot), and [pi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent).

## Background

Ralph implements the [Ralph Wiggum pattern](https://github.com/ghuntley/how-to-ralph-wiggum) — a technique for running AI coding agents in autonomous loops where each iteration picks up where the last left off. The name comes from Ralph Wiggum's famous line *"I'm helping!"*, which captures the spirit of an agent that cheerfully works through a task list one item at a time, without needing hand-holding between steps.

The pattern works in two phases: **plan** (analyse the codebase against specifications and produce a prioritised implementation plan) and **build** (pick the next item, implement it, run tests, commit, repeat). A shared `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` acts as the handoff between iterations, giving each fresh Claude session the context it needs to continue. The plan is split for context economy: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` is an index of one-line entries, each linking to a task file under `plan/` that holds the detail, so an iteration reads the whole queue but only the one task it is about to implement. An append-only `PROGRESS.md` log captures what each iteration did, what it learned, and what broke — providing a breadcrumb trail for both the human and future iterations.

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:marc0der/ralph.git
cd ralph
./install.sh
```

This places `ralph` in `~/.local/bin/`, default prompts in `~/.config/ralph/prompts/`, workspace templates in `~/.config/ralph/templates/`, and the devcontainer config in `~/.config/ralph/container/`.

## Commands

| Command           | Description                                                                  |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sandbox`         | Enter a devcontainer shell for the current project                           |
| `sandbox clean`   | Remove the devcontainer for the current project                              |
| `sandbox --rebuild` | Rebuild the container image from scratch                                   |
| `sandbox --no-inhibit-sleep` | Don't hold the host awake for the sandbox session                    |
| `plan`            | Analyse specs and source, create/update `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and the task files under `plan/` (max 6 iterations; exits as soon as a pass changes nothing, and fails if that happens with an empty plan) |
| `build`           | Pick the next item, implement, test, commit, push (default: 50 iterations)   |
| `review`          | Review the branch diff against specs and guardrails, write `REVIEW.md` — changes nothing else (default: 1 iteration) |
| `init`            | Initialise workspace (`PROGRESS.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `specs/`, `plan/`). Pass `--prompts` to also copy prompt templates for local customisation |
| `archive`         | Move `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `plan/` task files to `.ralph/<timestamp>/` |
| `clean`           | Delete `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `PROGRESS.md` and `plan/` task files       |
| `metrics`         | Summarise a run's loop metrics: per-iteration table plus totals (latest run, or pass a `metrics.jsonl` path) |
| `version`         | Print version                                                                |

### Options (plan, build and review)

| Flag                 | Description                                              |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `-n`, `--iterations` | Max iterations. In build mode this also disables the noop exit; in plan mode it caps the run but never disables the convergence exit; review has no early exit to disable |
| `-g`, `--goal`       | Goal injected into the prompt template                   |
| `-m`, `--model`      | Pin one model for all iterations, overriding per-item tiers |
| `-b`, `--backend`    | Backend to use: `claude`, `codex`, `copilot`, `pi` (default: `claude`) |
| `--skip-push`        | Don't push after each build iteration (plan and review never push) |
| `--dry-run`          | Print what would be executed without running              |
| `--no-metrics`       | Don't record per-iteration metrics under `.ralph/metrics/` |
| `-s`, `--stream`     | Live, readable activity log while each iteration runs (claude backend) |
| `-h`, `--help`       | Show help                                                |

### Review

`ralph review` runs a single read-only verification pass over the current branch: it diffs against the merge base with the default branch, maps every substantive change back to a spec or plan item, flags over-engineering (speculative abstraction, single-caller indirection, pattern duplication), and checks test integrity (weakened, deleted, or missing tests) and guardrail conformance. The output is `REVIEW.md` — verdict, traceability table, severity-ordered findings, and questions for the author — and nothing else: no source edits, no commits, no pushes. Use `-g` to narrow the focus or name a different diff base, and `-n` to run more than one pass. `REVIEW.md` is local-only (gitignored by `ralph init`), like the other loop artifacts.

### Watching a run

By default the loop is silent while an iteration runs, then prints the backend's
final message. `--stream` (or `-s`) renders the event stream as it arrives, so a
long run can be watched rather than waited out:

```
=================================== ITERATION 3 / 12 ===================================

Next:    [sonnet] Add GET /reference/{id} — single-record lookup.

    · I'll start with Phase 1 — understanding the current state.
    → Bash Read tail of progress
    → Read sam-frontend/src/server/routes/reference/index.js
    → Edit sam-frontend/src/server/routes/reference/index.js
    · Now Phase 3 — verify.
    → Bash Run the frontend test suite
    ✗ ENOENT: no such file
    → Skill commit
    ◆ success · 48 turns · $2.38
```

Each line is one event: `·` the agent's own commentary, `→` a tool call (its
description, or the file it touched), `✗` a tool call that failed, and `◆` the
end-of-iteration summary. Thinking blocks and successful tool output are left
out — the log is a summary of what happened, not a transcript.

This is not `--verbose`, which exists for debugging the pipeline: that prints the
backend command, the raw JSON, and exit codes, after the fact. The two can be
combined. `--stream` needs a backend that emits per-event JSON, which today means
`claude`; the others return a single response at the end, and the flag says so at
startup rather than doing nothing quietly.

### Loop metrics

Every real (non-dry-run) `plan` or `build` run records one JSON line per iteration to `.ralph/metrics/<branch>-<timestamp>-<pid>/metrics.jsonl`, alongside the raw backend event stream (`iter-NNN.stream.jsonl`) for deeper analysis. Captured per iteration: wall-clock and API duration, turn count, cost (USD), token usage (input, output, cache read/write), git activity (commits, files changed, insertions/deletions), `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` items completed, a tool-call histogram, and a noop flag. The loop prints a one-line summary after each iteration, and `ralph metrics` prints the per-iteration table and run totals. Result-event fields are populated for the `claude` backend; other backends record timing and git activity with the rest as nulls. `.ralph/` is gitignored by `ralph init`, so metrics never touch the working tree the loop commits from.

### Examples

```bash
ralph sandbox                                       # enter devcontainer
ralph sandbox --rebuild                             # rebuild and enter
ralph sandbox --no-inhibit-sleep                    # enter without holding the host awake
ralph sandbox clean                                 # remove the container
ralph plan                                          # analyse and plan
ralph plan -g "Migrate to hexagonal architecture"   # plan with a goal
ralph build                                         # implement next item
ralph build -n 10 -m sonnet                         # 10 iterations, sonnet pinned (ignores tiers)
ralph build -b codex                                # build using codex backend
ralph plan -b codex -g "design the auth module"     # plan with codex
ralph build --dry-run -b codex                      # dry-run with codex
ralph build -b copilot -n 10                        # 10 iterations with copilot
ralph build -b pi -n 10                             # 10 iterations with pi
ralph build --stream                                # watch the run as a readable log
ralph review                                        # review the branch, write REVIEW.md
ralph review -g "Focus on FT-001 rule coverage"     # review with a focus
ralph archive                                       # archive before starting fresh
ralph init                                          # initialise workspace
ralph init --prompts                                # also copy prompts for customisation
```

## Sandbox

The sandbox runs your project inside a devcontainer — an isolated environment with Claude Code, Codex CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Node.js 20, Bun, uv, SDKMAN, Docker CLI, and development tools pre-installed. The active backend runs as a non-root user with its backend-specific permission-bypass flag enabled.

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** (rootful) — rootless Docker is not supported
- **devcontainer CLI** — install with `npm install -g @devcontainers/cli`

### Usage

```bash
cd your-project
ralph sandbox              # start or reuse container, drop into zsh
ralph sandbox --rebuild    # rebuild image from scratch (after ralph updates)
ralph sandbox clean        # remove the container for this project
```

Each project gets its own container, automatically reused between sessions. Shell history persists across container recreations via a Docker volume.

A devcontainer is suspended along with its host, which stalls a long unattended `ralph build` run mid-iteration if the laptop sleeps. `ralph sandbox` holds the host awake for the duration of the session using the platform's sleep inhibitor — `caffeinate` on macOS, `systemd-inhibit` on Linux — releasing it on exit or Ctrl-C. If neither is available, ralph prints a warning and continues. Pass `--no-inhibit-sleep` to opt out.

### What gets mounted

| Source                    | Target                          | Mode      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| `~/.claude`               | `/home/node/.claude`            | read/write |
| `~/.codex`                | `/home/node/.codex`             | read/write |
| `~/.copilot`              | `/home/node/.copilot`           | read/write |
| `~/.pi`                   | `/home/node/.pi`                | read/write |
| `~/.gitconfig`            | `/home/node/.gitconfig`         | readonly  |
| `~/.ssh`                  | `/home/node/.ssh`               | readonly  |
| `~/.config/gh`            | `/home/node/.config/gh`         | readonly  |
| Docker socket             | `/var/run/docker.sock`          | read/write |
| SSH agent socket           | `/tmp/ssh-agent.sock`           | read/write |
| `ralph` binary            | `/usr/local/bin/ralph`          | readonly  |
| ralph config dir           | `/home/node/.config/ralph`      | readonly  |

Optional mounts (`~/.ssh`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.codex`, `~/.copilot`, `~/.pi`, SSH agent) are skipped if the source doesn't exist on the host. `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GH_TOKEN`, and `GITHUB_TOKEN` are forwarded into the container when set on the host. When neither `GH_TOKEN` nor `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set, ralph derives the token from `gh auth token` so keyring-stored `gh auth login` sessions propagate into the container (modern `gh` keeps the token in the OS keyring, which the `~/.config/gh` mount alone cannot carry). If `gh` is installed but logged out, ralph prints a warning and starts the sandbox without GitHub CLI authentication.

### SDKMAN

SDKMAN is installed but no JDK is pre-installed. If your project uses a `.sdkmanrc`, install the declared JDK inside the sandbox:

```bash
sdk env install
```

## Prompt resolution

Ralph looks for prompts in this order:

1. **Project-local** — `PROMPT_plan.md` / `PROMPT_build.md` / `PROMPT_review.md` in the working directory
2. **Installed defaults** — `~/.config/ralph/prompts/plan.md` / `build.md` / `review.md`

The default prompts reference Anthropic model names (Sonnet, Opus) for subagent selection. If you're using a non-Claude backend, run `ralph init --prompts` to copy the defaults into your project and edit them to suit your backend.

## Project artifacts

Ralph iterations create and maintain these files in your project:

| File                     | Purpose                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CLAUDE.md`              | Operational guardrails for the Claude backend — build commands, conventions, project rules. Read by every iteration to orient the agent. You maintain this file; ralph does not create or modify it |
| `AGENTS.md`              | Operational guardrails for the Codex backend — equivalent of `CLAUDE.md` for codex projects |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Prioritised index of work items, one line each — shared state between iterations |
| `plan/`                  | One `NNN-slug.md` task file per plan item, holding its scope, files and verification criteria |
| `PROGRESS.md`            | Append-only log of what each iteration did, learned, and broke|
| `REVIEW.md`              | Output of `ralph review` — verdict, traceability, findings    |
| `specs/`                 | Feature specifications driving the work                       |

**Note:** `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are your project's own configuration files for Claude Code and Codex respectively — ralph reads them but never creates or modifies them. The prompt templates reference both files so each backend gets relevant project-specific guidance.

`PROMPT_plan.md`, `PROMPT_build.md` and `PROMPT_review.md` are optional project-local prompt overrides (see [Prompt resolution](#prompt-resolution)).

### Plan layout

Every build iteration re-reads the plan in full, so the plan is deliberately split in two: a small index that is always read, and per-task detail that is only read when it is about to be worked on.

`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` holds one line per item, in priority order:

```markdown
- [x] **Add PATCH endpoint** — accept partial updates on `/items/{id}`. → [001-patch-endpoint.md](plan/001-patch-endpoint.md)
- [ ] **Wire up token refresh** — refresh expiring sessions without a re-login. → [002-token-refresh.md](plan/002-token-refresh.md)
```

Each entry links to `plan/NNN-slug.md`, which carries the scope, the files involved, the "done when" criteria, and — once the item ships — the build agent's completion notes:

```markdown
# 002. Wire up token refresh

**Status:** Not started

## Scope
...

## Done when
...
```

Numbers are allocated in order and never reused. Completed items and their task files are never deleted — the plan is an append-only ledger of what shipped.

Completion notes live in the task file, capped at about three lines, with the fuller narrative going to `PROGRESS.md`. What they never go in is the index — that's the file every iteration re-reads in full, so it stays one line per item however much history accumulates behind it.

**Note:** `ralph init` adds `plan/` to `.gitignore`, since task files are loop-local state. If your project already has a tracked `plan/` directory, rename one of them before running ralph — `clean` and `archive` only ever touch files matching the `NNN-slug.md` pattern, but the gitignore entry would still hide your own new files from git.

### The implementation plan contract

`specs/` states **what** to build. The plan states **how** to build it. The plan is a work queue, not a scratchpad — every line in it is an instruction or a pass/fail criterion. Outcomes, evidence and learnings go to `PROGRESS.md`; decisions and their reasoning go to `specs/`.

The index carries one line per item and nothing else:

```markdown
- [ ] **Retarget the polkit agent to the Sway session** — the agent follows the Sway session. → [007-polkit-session-target.md](plan/007-polkit-session-target.md)
```

Its task file carries the detail, in these fields and no others:

```markdown
# 007. Retarget the polkit agent to the Sway session

**Status:** Not started

## Spec

`specs/plasma-sway-remnants.md` item 3

## Scope

Add a session-target option. Do not change the Plasma agent.

## Files

`modules/home/keyring-services.nix`, `hosts/neomorph/home.nix`

## Steps

1. Add `polkitSessionTarget` to `keyring-services.nix`. Default it to `graphical-session.target`.
2. Set `polkitSessionTarget` to `sway-session.target` in `hosts/neomorph/home.nix`.

## Done when

Two `NRestarts` reads 30 seconds apart return the same number.

## Completion notes

_Left empty for the build agent._
```

- **At most 150 words and 8 steps per task file**, excluding the completion notes. An item needing a ninth step is too large for one build iteration and gets split.
- **Steps name greppable tokens** — symbols, option paths, literal values, files to copy an idiom from. Never line numbers, never pasted code, because an item runs many commits after it is written.
- **`Done when` must be checkable without a human.** A criterion needing a fresh login or a visual check belongs in the spec's acceptance criteria, not the plan — an item nobody can verify never completes, and the build loop selects it forever.
- **Task files are written in [Simplified Technical English](https://www.asd-ste100.org/)** — one instruction per sentence, 20 words maximum, active imperative present tense.

Markers in the index are `- [ ]` open, `- [x]` shipped, and `- [~]` superseded or blocked, each matching the `**Status:**` in its task file. Only `- [ ]` sizes the build loop, so a superseded item neither inflates the iteration count nor counts as shipped work.

The plan phase authors and refines items freely, inserting and reordering entries to keep position meaningful. **Once the build phase starts, the plan is immutable** — a build iteration may only tick a checkbox, append a new item at the end, and fill in the completion notes of the item it just finished. When an item turns out to be wrong or its spec contradicts it, the build agent marks it `- [~]`, records why in `PROGRESS.md`, and moves on; the next planning run writes the replacement.

This split assumes a capable model writes the plan and a cheaper one executes it. Use `-m` to match:

```bash
ralph plan                       # default model authors the plan
ralph build -n 10 -m sonnet      # a cheaper model follows the steps
```

### Starting a new goal

When switching to a new goal, clear out stale artifacts first:

```bash
ralph archive                                    # move to .ralph/<timestamp>/
ralph plan -g "New goal"
```

Or if you don't need the history:

```bash
ralph clean                                      # delete artifacts
ralph plan -g "New goal"
```

Archived artifacts are stored under `.ralph/` in your project directory, organised by timestamp.

## Commit conventions

The build phase commits via the `/commit` skill bundled with ralph and scaffolded by `ralph init` into `.claude/skills/commit/SKILL.md`. The skill enforces an opinionated style:

- **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — `<type>(<scope>): <short imperative subject>`
- **Atomic** — separable concerns become separate commits, even within a single build iteration
- **Selective staging** — only the paths belonging to the current commit are staged; never `git add -A`
- **Optional short body** — up to 3 bulleted lines summarising what was implemented, only when the subject isn't self-explanatory
- Loop-local artifacts (`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `plan/`, `PROGRESS.md`, `PROMPT_*.md`, `.ralph/`) are never staged

The scaffolded skill lives in your project's `.claude/skills/` and is not gitignored by `ralph init` — commit it to share with your team, or edit it locally if you want different conventions.

## Permissions and safety

Ralph runs backends in non-interactive pipe mode, which cannot prompt for tool approval. Each backend has its own permission-bypass flag (`--dangerously-skip-permissions` for Claude, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for Codex, `--yolo` for Copilot), and ralph applies the appropriate one automatically.

**Inside the sandbox** (`$DEVCONTAINER=true`), this is the intended setup — the container's isolation provides a safety boundary, so unrestricted tool access is acceptable.

**Outside a container**, ralph will print a prominent warning on each run. Use `ralph sandbox` to run inside a devcontainer for safer execution.

## Configuration

| Variable           | Default              | Description                     |
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| `RALPH_BIN_DIR`    | `~/.local/bin`       | Where to install the CLI        |
| `RALPH_CONFIG_DIR` | `~/.config/ralph`    | Where to store prompts and container config |

### Model selection

Build iterations vary in reasoning demand: adding an endpoint alongside
existing ones is cheaper work than reconciling contradictory specs. So in
`build` mode ralph picks the model **per iteration**, from the tier the
planning agent marked on that index entry:

```markdown
- [ ] (light) **Add PATCH /reference/{id}** — accept partial updates. → [007-patch.md](plan/007-patch.md)
```

| Tier    | Meaning                                                                              | `claude` | `codex`              |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------|
| `light` | Follows an established pattern, specs are clear, changes are localised                | `sonnet` | `gpt-5.2-codex-mini` |
| `heavy` | Cross-cutting refactors, spec reconciliation, debugging of unknown cause              | `opus`   | `gpt-5.2-codex`      |

The marker sits on the index line rather than in the task file, so the loop
chooses the model without opening `plan/NNN-*.md` first.

Tiers are deliberately abstract rather than model names: `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
is an append-only ledger that any backend may run, so each backend maps the tier
into its own namespace. Backends with no cheaper tier worth using map both to the
same model, and plans whose entries carry no marker simply use the backend
default throughout.

`ralph metrics` reports cost per model, so you can see what the split bought:

```
By model:
  opus: 4 iterations · cost $12.60 · plan items 4
  sonnet: 9 iterations · cost $3.15 · plan items 9
```

Resolution order is **`-m` flag → item tier → backend default**. The default
model per backend is:

- `claude` backend: `opus`
- `codex` backend: `gpt-5.2-codex`
- `copilot` backend: `claude-sonnet-4.6`
- `pi` backend: `anthropic/claude-opus-4-8`

The `-m` flag pins one model for every iteration, ignoring tiers entirely:

```bash
ralph build -m sonnet          # pin sonnet for the whole run, ignore tiers
ralph plan -m opus             # plan and review are single passes — always one model
ralph build -b codex           # uses gpt-5.2-codex / -mini per tier
ralph build -b codex -m o3     # override codex model
ralph build -b copilot         # uses claude-sonnet-4.6 by default
```

Tiering applies to `build` only — `plan` and `review` are single passes over the
whole plan, with no per-item work to tier.

## Development

Enter the Nix shell to get development dependencies (bats, shellcheck):

```bash
nix-shell
```

Run tests and lint:

```bash
bats test/
shellcheck ralph install.sh
shellcheck test/*.bats test/test_helper.bash
```

## Troubleshooting

**`claude` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the Claude Code CLI for the `claude` backend. Install it from https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `claude` in your PATH.

**`codex` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the Codex CLI for the `codex` backend. Install it with `npm install -g @openai/codex` — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `codex` in your PATH.

**`copilot` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the GitHub Copilot CLI for the `copilot` backend. Install it with `npm install -g @github/copilot` — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `copilot` in your PATH.

**`pi` CLI not installed**
Ralph requires the pi CLI for the `pi` backend. Install it with `npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` — ralph will exit with a clear error if it can't find `pi` in your PATH.

**`ralph` not in PATH after install**
The installer places `ralph` in `~/.local/bin` by default. Ensure this directory is in your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

**Push rejected / diverged branch**
If `git push` fails due to diverged history, pull and resolve conflicts manually, then re-run `ralph build` to continue.

**Resuming after a failed iteration**
Just re-run `ralph build`. It picks up from the current state of `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and the task files under `plan/` — no special recovery step is needed.

**Sandbox container is stale or broken**
Remove it and start fresh:
```bash
ralph sandbox clean
ralph sandbox
```

**Sandbox image needs updating**
After updating ralph, rebuild the container image:
```bash
ralph sandbox --rebuild
```

**`devcontainer` CLI not installed**
Install it with npm:
```bash
npm install -g @devcontainers/cli
```

**`sandbox` fails with `invalid mount config for type "bind": ... operation not supported`**

Ralph bind-mounts `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` into the container so git operations can reuse your host's ssh-agent. This fails when the socket lives at a path the Docker runtime's VM cannot bind-mount — either because the path is outside the VM's shared filesystem, or because the socket is a kernel-managed endpoint (e.g. a launchd-created socket on macOS) that doesn't survive the virtfs passthrough.

The symptom is a `docker run` error naming the SSH agent path, for example:

```
invalid mount config for type "bind": stat /private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.XXXXXX/Listeners: operation not supported
```

When this happens, depends on your setup:

- **macOS + Colima** — affected. Colima runs Docker inside a Lima VM that only mounts `$HOME` by default, and macOS's default `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` points at a launchd socket under `/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.*` which is neither mounted nor bind-mountable.
- **macOS + Docker Desktop** — not typically affected. Docker Desktop intercepts `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` and provides a magic `/run/host-services/ssh-auth.sock` passthrough.
- **macOS + Rancher Desktop / OrbStack / other Lima-based runtimes** — likely affected for the same reason as Colima.
- **Linux** — not affected. Docker runs natively on the host filesystem.

Workaround: run ralph with an empty `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` so the mount is skipped. Git inside the container will fall back to the read-only `~/.ssh` bind mount (fine for key-based auth without a passphrase):

```bash
SSH_AUTH_SOCK="" ralph sandbox
```
